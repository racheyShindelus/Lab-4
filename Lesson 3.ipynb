    "# Review: Functions\n",
    "A function in Python is similar to a method in Java: it has some inputs, does a computation, and produces an output. Last week we started learning about functions. Our definition of a function comes from a mathematical perspective: it's a computation that transforms one set of values (the *domain*) into another set (the *co-domain*). Such functions tend to be very simple: they take one single input (a value in the domain) and produce a single output (a value in the co-domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although in general functions (a.k.a. methods) can be quite lengthy, we desire to write short, concise functions that do a small amount of work. This will facilitate testing them. Once we are confident our functions are working, we can combine them (by having functions call other functions) to produce larger programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining functions\n",
    "A function definition starts with the keyword `def` and is followed by the name of the function and any inputs it may take. A colon and indentation is used to delimit the body of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in Java/C, the keyword `return` is used to cause the function to return a value back to the caller. With few exceptions, all of the function we will write return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input parameters and variables\n",
    "\n",
    "As with variables, there is no need to declare the types of input parameters. Just list their names inside parentheses. The input parameters become variables that are local to the function; they disappear once the function is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any other variables you define and use in the function are also local to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returning values\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can return any value that you can construct. This includes numbers, strings, arrays, tuples, etc. Functions can even return other functions; although this is a feature we won't need at this time."
